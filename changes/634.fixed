ServiceNow Integration
When running the Nautobot ‚üπ ServiceNow job with a site filter set, you expect the job to sync only the specified locations to ServiceNow. 
However, it appears that the job currently loads only the parent locations, not the specified location itself.
This is fixed by initializing the locations list with the user-selected location and then loading the parent locations of that selection.
